# UtilityCliParser

## A command-line parser for simple utility applications

This command-line parser can be used for simple utility console application scenarios. As a wrapper around [System.CommandLine](https://nuget.org/packages/System.CommandLine), UtilityCliParser provides easy support for happy-path scenarios without requiring the commands, options, and arguments to be predefined or modeled before parsing.

UtilityCliParser is not intended for CLI applications that are distributed to other users; rather it's intended for utility applications you create for yourself.
